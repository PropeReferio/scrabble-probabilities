# Scrabble Calculator

A simple python program that takes a string of seen letters as input, and prints the probabilities of drawing the remaining tiles.

### Example usage:
python chances --letters 'hellogre'

### Coming soon:
I'd like to add the ability to pass in an image or two as an option, and the program will read tiles from your hand and on the board.
